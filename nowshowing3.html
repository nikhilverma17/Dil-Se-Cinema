        <h2>7.9/10</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">
            Zwigato is a film about people who bring us our food, clean the malls and its loos, the
            kaam-waali and the malish-waali. It’s about rising unemployment and the growing gig
            economy. It’s about the mazdoor and their majboori. And it’s about modern India. Zwigato
            doesn’t have a single false note. It feels authentic, real. And
            I especially loved the note on which Das ends her film.
            The film’s last scene is a tough, conscious choice, but it’s one that is honest and
            keeps the film true to the people it is about. Instead of shining light on the film and
            its filmmaker, Das’ Zwigato gracefully bows out at the end, letting the humanity of
            those whose life it is portraying take centerstage.
            Kapil Sharma’s Manas is constantly in motion, on his bike. He has no time for anyone,
            not even the man who chases him to ask if he too can get a job with Zwigato, though he
            has a cycle and not a motorbike.
            Like the big, blue, square box that Manas carries on his back, Sharma carries the
            tension, desperation and anger of his character on his face, in his voice. He seems to
            be always thinking, worrying about getting a better job.
            Kapil Sharma is the most unexpected and inspired choice to play Manas, and he is very,
            very good. I will never forget the way he flinches when his embarrassed daughter asks
            him why he delivered food at the house of her classmate, and then says, “Khana khilana
            toh punya ka kaam hai”. (To feed people is a holy deed)
            But Zwigato really belongs to Shahana Goswami. She is the film’s heart draped in a
            simple saree with a mismatched blouse.
            She carries the character of Pratima in her whole body, but especially her eyes.
            Goswami is so precise, so natural and so insanely compelling that I could not take my
            eyes off her. There’s not a single false note in her performance, not a muscle out of
            place.
            Nandita Das has always been a very fine writer and director, but this is the first time
            that her activist politics is so beautifully woven into a story.

        <h2>7.9/10</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">
            Manas Singh Mahto (Kapil Sharma), a food delivery rider, wakes up to a twisted dream on a train in which
            he’s looking for a ‘Sugam Form’, which he is informed is an application for anyone to get a Government job.
            Of course, he wakes up getting back to his gig job of trying to deliver as much food as he can for more
            incentives/commission.
            While he struggles to bring in enough for the family, his wife Pratima (Shahana Goswami) insists on getting
            the sweeper’s job in a shopping mall. Manas, of course, gets insecure at one point, but it’s all about how
            he finds a ray of hope to live a life that isn’t really anywhere even close to 5-star.
        <h3>Script Analysis</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">Nandita Das & Samir Patil’s story of a poverty-stricken man finding his way through life
            is extremely beautiful in parts. Scenes featuring a Muslim delivery guy who is afraid to go to a temple to
            deliver food and a person getting declined from getting a Government job probably because of his cast harms
            more than favouring the film. I totally understand the reason behind including these scenes & I’m all up for
            it in any movie apart from this.</p>
        <h3>Star Performance</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">Kapil Sharma lies somewhere between being a complete miscast and nailing the character
            out of the park. His real-life backstory helps to connect with the innocence of Manas, but his ‘comedy
            master’ tag also proves to be a hindrance at times. More than the natural acting, at places, it feels like
            he’s pretending to act.

            Shahana Goswami is Shahana Goswami & there are no two schools of thought that there could’ve been a better
            Pratima than her. But, yes, Nandita could’ve written a better Pratima than what she currently has.</p>
        <h3> Direction</h3><hr>
        <p class="review-para">Nandita Das loves to cook movies on a slow burner as much as we love to see them. But
            this one doesn’t just drag at places; things start to get monotonous way sooner than they should. The lead
            jumping from one delivery to another, with the struggle, of course remaining the same, is something not many
            would be able to sit through without a break.</p>
        <h3>The Last Word</h3><hr>
        <p class="review-para">All said and done, the silver lining is that stars like Kapil Sharma are willing to
            explore such genres of cinema, but it’ll take a lot more than an actor’s willingness to master such stories.</p>

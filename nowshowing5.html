            A horrible try to copy KGF
            You know, there are some films that test your patience to an extent
            where you just want all of it to end or at least the theatre to burn down, so the misery
            ends once and for all—precisely that. Kannada cinema, indeed has found itself in a very
            new light as we speak. KGF, Kantara, and 777 Charlie are shining examples.Written by M
            Chandramouli and R. Chandru, Underworld Ka Kabzaa is literally a bunch of men
            gate-crashing a wonderful set every day and shooting narratives that will massage the
            ego of the evil inside them. Because nothing else explains the chaos and lack of story
            or structure to this movie that is, so hell-bent on celebrating toxicity all the time.
            It is just trying to multiply everything done in the last similar franchise with no
            nuance to it.Every actor was told to mimic somebody, and you can see it. There is no
            attempt to build a unique gangster whose story we would want to trace. The common brief
            for men is that they will have to walk around slitting throats and cutting heads. And
            women, of which only two inconsequential exist in this universe are supposed to serve
            the fragile egos of the men around them.

            Kichcha Sudeep, who has been used as the face for promotions, is literally a cameo.
            Upendra looks like he is forced to be here. All the villains are supposedly performing
            for their auditions in the Drag Race. Nothing else explains Nawab Shah’s obsession with
            his own cleavage.The direction, or the lack of it in Kabzaa is just unbearable. The
            visuals are unnecessarily gory and loud to an extent that you just want all of this to
            stop because it is too poorly done. Creating an edgy gangster drama is not just killing
            people as pass time and showing gallons of blood coming out of a slit throat. It is much
            more than that, and the directors need to know it.Music is just too loud for anyone who
            has ears. The art, costume, and production department need to have a word with a
            therapist. Why did you say yes to this job?
            Also, whoever decided to black out the screen after every five minutes throughout the
            movie and multiple times during an action sequence on the edit table, please don’t ever
            even think of repeating that.Kabzaa is a crash course on how not to make a gangster
            drama because everything about it is wrong.

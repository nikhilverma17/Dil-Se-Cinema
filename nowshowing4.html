        <h1 class="review-heading">Mrs. Chatterjee Vs Norway</h1>
        <h2>9.2/10</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">
            Post taking us through the opening montage of the colourful aura of Norway, we’re immediately dropped amidst
            a tension-filled scene of Debika Chatterjee (Rani Mukerji) running for her life to save her toddlers from
            the Norwegian Child Welfare Services (Barnevernet, referred in the film as Velfred). On the other hand, her
            husband, Anirudh Chatterjee (Anirban Bhattacharya), struggles to obtain citizenship in the country.

            Velfred obtains her kids because Debika is not a fit mother to them because she makes them eat food with
            their hands, apply kohl to their face & other things primarily based on the ‘cultural difference’. Debika,
            without any support from anyone, tries to do everything possible to get her children back, unravelling
            things that one might rule out, calling it ‘gossip’.
            <h3>Script Analysis</h3><hr>
            <p class="review-para"> Director Ashima Chibber, along with Sameer Satija & Rahul Handa writes, adapts the story
            from the book The Journey Of A Mother, which is an autobiography of Sagarika
            Chakraborty, on whose life the story is based. The task of emoting a mother’s pain is
            beautifully carried out by the script, relying heavily on an astounding performance by
            Rani Mukerji. Yes, it does get monotonous by the early second half, but that’s exactly
            where the tables are turned, infusing a well-drafted courtroom drama.</p>
            <h3>Star Performance</h3><hr>
            <p class="review-para">Hichki, Mardaani 2 and now this, can we all take a moment and appreciate how amazing
            Rani Mukerji has been off-late in not only mixing & choosing different scripts but also
            nailing each one of them. Yes, there have been big breaks in between, but if those can
            give you this. She’s as natural a natural can get; even when loud, Rani doesn’t cross
            the set
            decibel limit of excruciating your emotional self.

            Anirban Bhattacharya delivers an all-controlled performance understanding the assignment
            of being a shady husband to a loving wife. As it’s adapted from a real-life story, one
            can’t complain about being gender-neutral. Jim Sarbh’s character as an Indian Norwegian
            lawyer builds intrigue retaining the viewers’ attention. The perfect way of showcasing
            subtlety helps him to be on both sides of the fence, evoking curiosity throughout the
            film.

            A special mention for Balaji Gauri, who plays the Bengali Lawyer in the second half; her
            performance turns the table, saving the story from getting repetitive. Less screen
            space, more effective.</p>
            <h3>Direction</h3><hr>
            <p class="review-para"> Ashima Chibber does everything to depict the pain of a mother as she narrates the story
            from her perspective.</p>
            <h3>The Last Word</h3><hr>
            <p class="review-para">  All said and done, in the spectrum of displaying mothers’ pain in cinema, this one would
            continue to ache for a long time owing to Rani Mukerji’s earnest presence in the film.</p>

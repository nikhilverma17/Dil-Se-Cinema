        <h1 class="review-heading">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h1>
        <h2>8.2/10 </h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">
            ‘Ant-Man’ Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is living a life that ‘doesn’t make
            sense’ according to him, and so does this movie according to many viewers including me.
            ‘AntMan’, daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) now living with ‘Wasp’ Hope van Dyne
            (Evangeline Lilly) and her genius parents ‘OG AntMan’ Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) & ‘OG
            Wasp’ Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer).Jeff Loveness’ story serves more to Marvel’s
            cinematic universe than its superhero realm and storyline. Ant-Man as a superhero
            doesn’t hold as much of an identity as Marvel superheroes in the past, it’s about Kang,
            it’s about Janet, hell it’s even about Cassie. The quantum realm designed is nowhere
            near the dystopia created by Black Panther’s Wakanda or Thor’s Asgard.

            It’s just a confusing amalgamation of some trippy elements with a Star Wars meet Dune
            kinda world having beings who look like Broccoli. William Pope’s cinematography is
            overshadowed by the extremely heavy VFX panning as there are hardly any sequences
            boasting even decent camera skills to talk about. The stretched-out transition to the
            Quantum realm scene in this one can’t hold a candle to Multiverse Of Madness’ jumping
            through the universe’s sequence.Paul Rudd continues to play the confused superhero whose
            individual identity has blurred by mixing elements from Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man &
            Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool. Yes, he has the charisma but when was the last time only that
            has worked for a superhero? Evangeline Lilly, too, is cruising toward making hope a
            hopeless character. The physical approach towards ‘Wasp’ holds her back from moulding
            herself as a superhero.

            Jonathan Majors’ Kang deserved a better launchpad than this. He definitely will do a lot
            better than this but if the first impression is considered to be the last, then let us
            remember ‘He Who Remains’ from Loki & not Kang from this one. Kathryn Newton does
            beautifully well as Cassie but her character sketch restricts her. Michelle Pfeiffer’s
            Janet becomes the central character and remains to be the best thing about the mess.
            Michael Douglas’ Hank gets a couple of ‘I Am The OG Ant-Man’ moments but they don’t land
            owing to the mediocre writing. Bill Murray’s cameo is a colourful delight.With the first
            couple of installments, Peyton Reed was on his way to directing one of the worst Marvel
            movies and he has reached there with this one. Moving from the ‘timepass’ category,
            Peyton moves to the bottom-of-the-barrel stuff. Keeping MODOCK’s design similar to the
            ones in the cartoon would remain to be one of the most laughable decisions.All said and
            done, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania starts Marvel’s Phase 5 on such a low note that
            anything from here would look good. Unfortunately, this one just doesn’t ‘fly’.
            And in last MODOK deserves to be a villen not a joker.

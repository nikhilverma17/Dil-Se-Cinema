        <h1 class="review-heading">Shazam! Fury of the Gods</h1>
        <h2>8.5/10</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="review-para">Shazam’s first scene would immediately make you feel it’s like a
            David F. Sandberg film when a considerable amount of people are asked to ‘unleash
            the chaos’ by the daughters of Atlas (Helen Mirren, Lucy Liu), and they do the same
            by forming a zombie-chain reaction eventually turning themselves into dust. Yes, the
            intro scene screams David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation), but that’s
            about it because post that, we see the routine superheroes’ stuff of saving the
            world & family.

            Why are the daughters of Atlas unleashing chaos on the people of Earth? Well,
            remember Shazam (Zachary Levi) breaking the magic staff in the first movie? Yeah,
            that belonged to the goddesses, and hence they’re here to unleash their fury upon
            the planet Earth. Shazam infused superpowers into his foster family as well, and
            you’ll get no points for guessing who’ll be on his side to fight the fury of the
            gods. Family!!!
        <h3>Script Analysis</h3><hr>
        <p class="review-para"> Henry Gayden (Shazam!) & Chris Morgan (Fast & Furious) are the two writers inculcating the exact two flavours
        into the story they know and have mastered. The flavour of a superhero doing routine shit is by Henry & why a
        family is needed to save the superhero is the essence brought in by Chris, who has written six of ten Fast &
        Furious films (+ Hobbs & Shaw as well). It nails the fun portions but fails to deliver otherwise.
        From the lead hero going to a paediatrician for therapy to a ‘Chat GPT’ like pen named Steve helping the team to
        write letters (delivering one outrightly hilarious letter-reading scene), the interest to watch the film highly
        elevates when it’s not trying to do the ‘superhero’ stuff. Other than that, it travels on the same boat every
        other superhero film is nowadays by posing a threat to a country/world and letting the heroes clean the mess to
        get applause (and a guaranteed sequel with a post-credit scene) by the end. Other than that, it
        travels on the same boat every other superhero film is nowadays by posing a threat
        to a country/world and letting the heroes clean the mess to get applause (and a
        guaranteed sequel with a post-credit scene) by the end.</p>
        <h3>Star Performance</h3><hr>
        <p class="review-para"> Zachary Levi continues to be
        the Deadpool for kids with his imposter syndrome and childlike ability to deal as a
        superhero with Shazam. The idea of an innocent, harmless & naive full-bodied
        superhero has just been scratched with the first two parts, and it might get onto
        something in the future. Adam Brody, Ross Butler and other superheroes from the
        family don’t contribute much to get noticeable limelight in the film.
        Rachel Zegler(ONLY REASON TO WATCH WHOLE MOVIE), as Anne, gets involved in one of
        the most dragging tracks of the
        film, not getting much to explore despite having a good amount of screen time. Lucy
        Liu & Helen Mirren, as Anne’s elder sisters and daughters of Atlas, needed more
        attention than they got. Djimon Hounsou is hilarious AF & his character of the
        wizard gets much meat to bring in comical relief whenever the narrative starts to
        sink.</p>
        <h3>Final Words</h3><hr>
        <p class="review-para">All said and done, Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania made Marvel look more like
        DC and Shazam! Fury Of The Gods makes DC look more like Marvel. It’d be fascinating
        to see the next moves of these superhero films churning production houses while we
        wait for some of the baseless mid/post-credit scenes (this one has 2).</p>
